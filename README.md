# Sudoku-Solver

Sudoku solver with image detection, meant for windows. Uses pytesseract and sudoku solving code from Computerphile.
Personal project done in one afternoon when I got a stroke of inspiration. Code is messy. Expect little if any updates.
Currently only supports windows
(no comments cause nobody's gonna read this code anyway)

### Installation:
------

clone repository

create virtual environment

activate virtual environment

install requirements.txt using pip

install tesseract by Google and copy Tesseract-OCR directory to directory where main.py is located (spelling and case-sensitive for Tesseract-OCR directory)

### Usage
------

Use Windows + Shift + S to copy outside edges of sudoku puzzle.

activate virtual environment

Run main.py

follow instructions

if incorrect numbers detected, try screenshotting again and run the program again. (The higher the picture resolution, the more accurate it will be)
